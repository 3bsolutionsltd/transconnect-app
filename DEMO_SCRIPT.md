## TROUBLESHOOTING DURING DEMO

### If Internet Fails:
- **Plan B**: Use pre-recorded video walkthrough
- **Plan C**: Use prepared screenshots in presentation
- **Messaging**: "Notice even without internet, the QR validation still works offline"

### If App Crashes:
- **Plan B**: Switch to backup device immediately
- **Messaging**: "This is a demo environment - production is more stable. This is exactly why we have a pilot phase."

### If Scanner Won't Scan:
- **Plan B**: Increase phone brightness to maximum
- **Plan C**: Use printed QR code sample
- **Messaging**: "Ensure QR codes are printed clearly, or passengers show full brightness on phone"

### If Questions Interrupt Flow:
- **Response**: "Great question! Let me finish this flow and I'll address it - I have a Q&A section prepared."
- **Alternative**: "I'll show you exactly how that works in the next section."

## DEMO BEST PRACTICES

### Do's:
- ✅ Speak slowly and clearly while demoing
- ✅ Hold devices so everyone can see
- ✅ Narrate what you're doing ("Now I'm clicking...")
- ✅ Pause after each section for reactions
- ✅ Make eye contact between actions
- ✅ Smile and show enthusiasm
- ✅ Relate features to their pain points

### Don'ts:
- ❌ Rush through screens
- ❌ Assume they understand tech terms
- ❌ Skip the QR scanning part (most impressive)
- ❌ Apologize for demo glitches
- ❌ Get defensive if they're skeptical
- ❌ Show unfinished features

---

## POST-DEMO TALKING POINTS

### Immediately After Demo:

**Strong Close:**
*"What you just saw took 8 minutes. Imagine how much time and money this saves EVERY SINGLE DAY. The pilot program costs you nothing. You can literally start in two weeks. Who wants to be first?"*

### If They're Impressed:
*"I have signup forms right here. Let's get you scheduled for training this week."*

### If They're Hesitant:
*"I understand this is new. That's exactly why we're doing a FREE 3-month pilot. No risk, just opportunity. What's your main concern?"*

### If They Want to "Think About It":
*"Absolutely. But know that we have limited spots for the pilot - only 10 operators. Your competitors might be signing up right now. Can we at least schedule a follow-up call?"*

## BACKUP DEMO MATERIALS

**If Live Demo Not Possible:**
1. **Video Walkthrough**: Have 5-minute demo video on USB drive
2. **Screenshots**: Printed color screenshots of each screen
3. **Sample QR Tickets**: Printed tickets they can hold

## CONFIDENCE REMINDERS

Before starting demo:
- **Take a deep breath**
- **You know this platform inside-out**
- **You're solving THEIR problem**
- **The demo will impress them**
- **Focus on value, not perfection**
